# SafeCycles
Flask Prototype for planning safe routes for cyclists &amp; pedestrians

## Features
- Uses GIS maps from https://dcenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=a30af518e87a4c0ab2fbde2aaac3c228 and https://www.opencyclemap.org/ and hopefully county councils/RSA for planning of routes along existing cycle lanes
- Uses current weather data to avoid cross winds over a specified threshold and steep hills on windy days
- Incident reporting system to allow users to report dangerous intersections/routes which will be avoided in route planning

## Prototype
This prototype application will be built in flask to showcase the feature set of logging and checking the incident management system

## Market
There is a market for this application despite some competitors
The competitors are either paywalled or extremely slow/buggy
The incident reporting and weather consideration provide a unique feature
